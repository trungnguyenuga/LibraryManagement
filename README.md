 **PURPOSE**\
The inspiration behind our library management app came from seeing how traditional library systems struggle with outdated, time-consuming processes. The app makes organizing books, tracking loans, and managing members easier.\
\
 **TOOLS UTILIZED**\
We built our library management app using Java with the JavaFX framework and Maven. For hosting, we leveraged AWS(Amazon Web Services) and DBeaver, while SceneBuilder helped us design the user interface. We use GitHub for teamwork, and IntelliJ IDEA for coding.\
\
 **PROBLEM WE RAN INTO**\
It took us a lot of time to discover AWS.Optimizing database management with DBeaver also took a lot of time. At our final step to build an executable .jar file, presented challenges, requiring us to troubleshoot dependencies and configurations.\
